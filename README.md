Objective:

To apply your understanding of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in Java by designing and implementing a small Java application using classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.

Problem Statement:

Design a simple library management system. The system should manage books, members, and borrowing transactions. Your application should demonstrate the use of OOP principles.

Requirements:

    Classes and Objects:
        Create a class Book with attributes such as title, author, ISBN, and availability.
        Create a class Member with attributes such as name, memberId, and borrowedBooks.
        Create a class Library that holds a collection of books and members and provides methods to add books, register members, and manage borrowing transactions.
    Inheritance:
        Create a subclass EBook that extends Book with additional attributes like fileFormat and fileSize.
        Create a subclass PremiumMember that extends Member with additional benefits such as borrowing more books than regular members.
    Polymorphism:
        Implement method overriding in EBook and PremiumMember classes.
        Use polymorphism to process borrowing transactions for both Member and PremiumMember.
    Encapsulation:
        Ensure that all attributes are private and provide public getter and setter methods.
        Implement validation in setter methods to ensure data integrity.

Implementation:

    Write a main class LibraryManagementSystem with a main method to demonstrate the functionality of your library management system.
    Implement methods to:
        Add new books to the library.
        Register new members.
        Borrow books for members.
        Display the list of available books.
        Display the list of registered members.

Sample Output:

    The main method should demonstrate the following scenarios:
        Adding books and eBooks to the library.
        Registering regular and premium members.
        Borrowing books for members and displaying the updated list of available books.
        Displaying member details along with borrowed books.

By completing this assignment, you will demonstrate your ability to design and implement a Java application using Object-Oriented Programming principles, preparing you for more advanced topics and real-world applications.
